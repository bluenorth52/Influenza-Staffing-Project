# Influenza-Staffing-Project
Project completed with Career Foundry for a ficticious medical staffing agency preparing for the 2018 Influenza season
# What is the Influenza Staffing Project?
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics
and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza
season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will
examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for
staffing needs across the country.
# Key Project Questions and Goals
Do states with a higher population have a higher death count? Is one age group more vulnerable (have a higher reported number of deaths) than all others? What can be done to help this agency distribute staff to states with the most deaths? What can be done to continue to improve patient care and reduce the number of deaths, if possible?
